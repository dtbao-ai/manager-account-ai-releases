# Changelog

What changed in each published version of **Manager Account AI**. Newest
first. Written by the release workflow, which inserts one section directly below
the marker line — do not remove it, and do not reorder what is under it.

## v0.2.8 — 2026-10-08

### Changed

- **T112** — The usage overlay is now only as big as what it shows. The bar
  style drops the account name and keeps just the two figures; every other
  style is trimmed to its content, with room kept for a figure of 100%. The
  list style no longer cuts off the bottom of its last row.
- **T111** — The Usage table's header row no longer has a grey band of its
  own; it now reads as part of the card, like the rows under it.
- **T110** — The dark theme now sits on plain black. The blue and purple glow
  behind the pages is gone, so every page has the same background; the light
  theme keeps its soft gradient.
- **T109** — Every rectangular surface now has the same small 5 px corner:
  cards, sidebar, status bar, buttons, fields, rows, dialogs, banners and the
  overlay. Switches, avatars, round icon buttons and pill badges stay round.
- **T108** — The usage overlay now always sits in the bottom-right corner of
  the main display, just above the taskbar, whatever its style; a taller style
  grows upward from that corner. It can no longer be dragged, so the position
  it used to remember is gone, and an old saved one is ignored. A change of
  resolution, scaling or taskbar puts it back in the corner.

### Fixed

- **T107** — The Accounts page now shows usage the moment the app opens.
  It used to only read what the poller already had, and the poller did not
  start until the Usage page was opened, so every ring said "not polled yet".
  It now starts polling the same way the Usage page does: once, and a running
  poller is only swept again when its figures are older than one interval.
  Polling, and the automatic rotation that follows it, therefore begins when
  the main window first opens.

### Added

- **T106** — A new look: glass, after Apple's iOS and visionOS materials.

  Content now sits on translucent cards floating over a soft coloured
  backdrop, with a floating sidebar and status bar, larger rounded corners,
  Windows' Display type for titles, and Apple's system blue as the accent.
  Every on/off setting is a switch; buttons and the sidebar answer the moment
  they are pressed; dialogs rise in as solid sheets over a dimmed, blurred app.
  Light and dark both follow the new palette.

  The Accounts page is now a grid of cards, each with the account's 5-hour and
  7-day usage as rings — the same rings the overlay's *Ring* style draws, and
  the same rule that an account the poller has not reached says so instead of
  showing zero. The overlay itself picks up the material: a tinted frame with
  a highlight along its top edge, round buttons, and nothing smaller than 12 px.

  If Windows is set to reduce transparency, every glass surface turns solid;
  with high contrast, the hairlines become real borders; with reduced motion,
  nothing scales or slides.

  The app icon is unchanged and still uses the previous green.

- **T105** — The usage overlay comes in five styles, chosen in *Settings ›
  Usage overlay*, which also switches it on and off.

  | Style | What it shows |
  |-------|---------------|
  | Bar | One line: the active account, both windows as a meter and a percentage |
  | Ring | Two rings, 5-hour and 7-day, with the percentage inside |
  | Compact | The smallest: the active account and whichever window is fuller |
  | Card | Both windows with their reset times, and how fresh the figures are |
  | List | Every enabled account, one row each, the active one marked |

  Both controls apply the moment they are clicked, like the theme; the overlay
  resizes itself to the new style on the spot. *Save* no longer sends the
  overlay settings at all, so a form left open cannot undo a change made from
  the tray or the overlay itself. The list grows by one row per enabled account
  up to eight, then says how many more there are.

  No style asks Windows for a window shorter than 40 px: a 34 px `compact` came
  back 39 px tall, because Windows will not make one shorter.

- **T104** — A usage overlay: a small window that stays on top of everything
  and keeps the active account's usage in view while the app sits in the tray.

  Turn it on from the tray menu (*Usage overlay*). It opens top-centre of the
  main display, shows the 5-hour and 7-day figures as a meter and a percentage,
  never takes the keyboard from whatever you are typing in, and has no taskbar
  button. Drag it anywhere; it comes back to the same place next start, and if
  that place was on a monitor that is no longer plugged in it comes back to the
  main display instead. ↗ opens the app, × (or Alt+F4) turns it off. Figures
  older than two poll intervals fade and say *stale*.

  It draws the usage poller's figures and never asks Anthropic anything itself,
  but while it is on it keeps that poller running from launch — so the
  automatic account rotation now runs from launch too, instead of from the
  first visit to the Usage page. Same requests at the same staggered cadence.

  Two side fixes the second window needed: every account action now tells all
  windows about the change (a switch made in the main window left the overlay
  on the old account), and with *Keep running in the tray* off, closing the
  main window still quits the app while the overlay is shown.

  This release draws the overlay in the `bar` style only; the other four styles
  and the Settings picker follow.

- **T103** — Settings and a shared view model for the coming usage overlay.

  Three new settings, all inert until the overlay window lands: `overlayEnabled`
  (off), `overlayStyle` (`bar`, one of `bar` / `ring` / `compact` / `card` /
  `list`) and `overlayPosition` (`null` until the overlay is dragged). The main
  process refuses an unknown style or a position that is not two finite numbers,
  rounds a position to whole pixels, and puts a hand-edited bad value on disk
  back to its default at load instead of failing. A vault from an older build
  picks the defaults up through the usual merge.

  `src/shared/overlay.ts` decides what every style shows, so a style is only a
  layout: the active account (or, for `list`, every enabled account in rotation
  order), 5-hour and 7-day figures as whole percentages with the Usage table's
  80 % / 100 % tones, a reason instead of a figure when there is none — never a
  0 % — and a stale mark once the newest figure is older than two poll
  intervals.

- **T102** — Tokens stay alive for every enabled account, not just the one on
  screen.

  The report was "switch to an account I have not selected in a while and Claude
  Code asks me to sign in again". The cause was not a guard reading backwards
  this round — it was that **nothing was calling the refresh chain at all**.
  `accessTokenFor` only runs when something wants a token, and the only two
  things that wanted one were the usage poller, which `IPC.usageStart` starts and
  leaving the Usage page stops, and the inbound server, which is off by default.
  `activateAccount` then writes the stored pair into `~/.claude` verbatim — no
  freshness check, no refresh.

  The log file proved it rather than the code being re-read: `app-2026-09-01.log`
  through `-09-10.log` hold two lines each and never the `polling every …`
  banner, and `activated embteam03@… (token …wAAA)` appears on 08-31 at 18:02 and
  again on 09-11 at 16:05 — the same access token, untouched for eleven days,
  last refreshed on 08-31 at 16:54. The switch handed Claude Code a pair eleven
  days dead.

  `createTokenKeeper` in `src/main/token-access.ts` is the answer: a background
  loop started from `index.ts` at `whenReady` and stopped at `will-quit`,
  deliberately independent of the usage poller because it must run whatever page
  is open. It sweeps every enabled account through the shared `accessTokenFor`
  sequentially — at most one token request in flight — once immediately and then
  every 15 minutes. A sweep over fresh tokens costs no request at all, because
  `accessTokenFor` returns at its freshness check. A terminal `invalid_grant`
  puts that account's refresh token into a hold keyed on the token itself, so the
  loop stops asking until a fresh login changes it; a transient failure is not
  held and is retried next sweep. Its lines carry the `[tokens]` tag, distinct
  from the poller's `[usage]`.

  `accessTokenFor` is now one module-level value in `ipc.ts` rather than one built
  per caller, so the poller, the keeper and the server all queue behind the same
  `refreshGate` — Anthropic rotates the refresh token on every exchange, and two
  callers refreshing one account at once leaves a spent pair written over a live
  one.

  `tests/token-keeper.test.ts` covers the immediate sweep, disabled accounts
  skipped, the dead-grant hold and its release on a new refresh token, and a
  transient failure retried.

  **What this does not buy.** A refresh token has two clocks. Its hard expiry does
  not slide with use — Anthropic's CLI documentation says so, and the pair minted
  by the 2026-09-11 login came back with `refresh_token_expires_in` of 28.66 days,
  a fixed date the new login did not push out. The keeper reaches the other clock:
  a grant that is never used appears to be invalidated server-side well before
  that date, which `rynfar/meridian` observed directly and answered with the same
  kind of traffic-independent timer. So an account left past its hard expiry still
  needs *Login again*, and nothing here changes that.

  Constants cross-checked against other clients speaking this flow rather than
  taken on trust: the client id, the `platform.claude.com/v1/oauth/token`
  endpoint, the 8 h access-token lifetime (measured exactly), and the
  `refresh_token_expires_in` field name all agree. One claim from `meridian` was
  tested and did **not** reproduce here — that Claude Code cannot read a
  pretty-printed `.credentials.json` — so this app keeps writing it formatted; the
  finding is recorded as the first thing to re-test if a switch ever reads as
  logged out.

## v0.2.7 — 2026-08-24

### Removed

- **T101** — Switch no longer raises a *"Switched to …"* banner.

  The card the user just clicked grows an **Active** badge; the banner said the
  same thing a second time, lower down the page, and then had to be dismissed —
  outliving the action it described. Gone with it: `switchedTo` and
  `dismissSwitchNotice` from the store, which existed for nothing else, and the
  `get` parameter of the store factory, which only that code used.

  What goes with it, stated rather than glossed: that banner was the only place
  the Accounts page said *"restart Claude Code to pick it up — a session already
  running keeps the previous token"*. The tray notification for an automatic
  rotation still says it; a manual switch now says nothing. Nothing is added back
  in its place unless it turns out to be missed.

  Verified as a removal should be — on the built bundle rather than by driving the
  UI: `Switched to`, `switchedTo`, `dismissSwitchNotice` and
  `Restart Claude Code to pick it up` are all absent from
  `out/renderer/assets/*.js`, while `Login again` is still there to prove the
  bundle read was the new one.

### Changed

- **T100** — The token chain the poller runs is now testable, and tested.

  `harvest → freshness → refresh → persist → mirror`. Three separate
  "sign in again" bugs this round came out of that sequence — T90 read the
  harvest's direction backwards, T91 found the mirror missing, T99 found a third
  route into it — and it was the one part of the whole path with no test, for a
  structural reason: `accessTokenFor` sat inline in `ipc.ts`, which imports
  `electron` and therefore cannot be loaded under vitest. The bank had it down as
  "reasoned, never watched", and closing it was going to mean leaving a machine
  idle for eight hours and hoping to read the right log line.

  So the sequence moved to `src/main/token-access.ts`, which imports no
  `electron` and reaches the vault through three injected functions —
  `captureRotatedToken`, `getAccount`, `updateAccountOauth`. `ipc.ts` supplies
  them and keeps the real `~/.claude`; the test supplies them bound to a temp
  home. This is the same testability boundary the architecture already draws for
  `oauth.ts`, `server.ts` and `usage-poller.ts`.

  Seven cases, and only the network is a stand-in — the vault is the real
  `store.ts`, `~/.claude` is a real directory, and the assertions are on the bytes
  Claude Code would read at its next start:

  - a stale token is refreshed and the rotated pair reaches **both** readers, the
    vault and the file (disable the mirror and this one fails, which is what makes
    it a test of the link rather than of the fixture);
  - a fresh token spends no request at all;
  - a pair Claude Code rotated is harvested instead of refreshing, so the token it
    already spent is never sent to be rejected;
  - a refresh token the stored date says has expired is refused without a request;
  - a rejected grant surfaces as terminal and leaves **neither** reader holding
    half a rotation;
  - a non-active account's refresh does not touch `~/.claude`;
  - two concurrent callers make **one** request, because a refresh token is
    single-use and the second would spend what the first rotated away.

### Fixed

- **T99** — A re-login of the **active** account now reaches
  `~/.claude/.credentials.json` too.

  T91 mirrored a *refresh* to that file. A **login** never went through the same
  door: `upsertSecret` writes the vault and the launcher profile, and only
  `updateAccountOauth` mirrors. So *Login again* on the account currently written
  into `~/.claude` moved the vault ahead of the file and left it there.

  Confirmed from a real machine rather than reasoned, once the auto-continue from
  T98 made the button usable end to end:

  | | mtime | Holds |
  |---|-------|-------|
  | `vault.json` | 17:45:07 | the pair the login just produced |
  | `~/.claude/.credentials.json` | 13:28:29 | `token …1gAA`, `expiresAt 14:28:04` — **expired three hours earlier** |

  That `…1gAA` is exactly what the log recorded at `13:28:29 activated
  embteam05 (token …1gAA)`. Claude Code was holding a dead access token and a
  refresh token from the superseded grant, while a live pair sat in the vault
  unused — the same shape as T90 and T91, arriving by a third route.

  The mirror moves into `upsertSecret`, behind the same identity guard, so
  signing in as somebody else still writes nothing to a file that names another
  account. A brand-new entry deliberately gets no mirror: the only caller that
  makes one active is `importCurrentAccount`, whose pair was read off that very
  file a moment earlier.

- **T98** — The auto-continue from **T97** now actually runs. It never did.

  Caught the only way it could be: the address was filled in but the page waited
  for a click, and **none of that feature's three log lines were in the file** —
  not the success, not the "could not press", not the failure. Three exhaustive
  branches and no line from any of them says the code never executed, which is a
  sharper diagnosis than any of them individually. The line existed for a
  renamed button; it caught a hook that never fired.

  T97 assumed the authorize URL redirects to the login page, and tested for
  `/login` in the URL at `did-finish-load`. It does not. Measured:

  | t | Event | URL |
  |---|-------|-----|
  | 231 ms | `did-redirect-navigation` | → `claude.ai/oauth/authorize` (cross-origin 302) |
  | 733 ms | `did-finish-load` | `claude.ai/oauth/authorize` — nothing to press yet |
  | 1072 ms | `did-navigate-in-page` | → `claude.ai/login?email=…` |

  The step to `/login` is same-origin, so claude.ai takes it with `pushState`:
  one document, and **no second `did-finish-load`**. The URL test therefore
  rejected the single event it ever saw.

  The fix removes the test rather than repairing it. The script polls the DOM
  already, its JS context survives an in-page navigation, and its own condition —
  a filled address field plus a button matching `/continue with email/i` — is
  strictly more precise than a substring of a URL. So: one injection at the only
  document load, no URL condition, and twenty seconds instead of ten to cover
  that route change on a slow network. Verified against the live page — injected
  at `/oauth/authorize`, resolved 466 ms later on `/login` with the button found
  and enabled.

### Added

- **T97** — *Login again* fills the address in and submits it, so the window opens
  on the code.

  Two halves, and only the first is a supported parameter. The authorize URL now
  carries `login_hint=<the account's email>` for a re-login. Anthropic honours it:
  the endpoint answers with a redirect to
  `claude.ai/login?email=<hint>&selectAccount=true`, and that page renders with
  `input[type=email]` already holding the value. Measured against the live
  endpoint, not taken from the OIDC spec — the same probe read the four buttons
  back (`Continue with email`, `SSO`, `Google`, `Apple`).

  That still left a click before the code field, so the second half presses it:
  a small script injected into the login window polls for up to ten seconds and
  clicks *Continue with email*. **The filled field is the guard**, and it guards
  two things — it proves the hint actually landed, so a page that ignored it is
  never clicked blindly, and it is gone at the code step, which is what stops a
  second injection pressing anything twice. Verified read-only against the live
  page: the predicate matched on its first tick, the button found by text and not
  disabled. The click itself was not fired, because doing so would have sent a
  real login attempt for a made-up address.

  What it costs, stated rather than buried:

  - It depends on Anthropic's DOM. A renamed button means no click — and the
    fallback is the page exactly as it was before this existed, plus a log line
    saying `could not press "Continue with email"`. That line is the whole point:
    a silent no-op would be a bug nobody could diagnose.
  - It submits the address, so the code email is sent the moment the window
    opens. For an account that signs in with Google or Apple that is the wrong
    path, and the dialog says the token follows whoever signs in, not the button
    pressed.
  - An account imported without an identity has no address stored. It gets no
    hint, no click, and the dialog says to type it as usual.

  Adding an account is untouched: no hint, no injection, the same flow it always
  had. The paste-a-code route carries the hint too — it fills the field wherever
  that URL is opened, including a browser this app did not pick, where nothing of
  ours can press anything.

### Changed

- **T96** — CI tests code and builds nothing. This supersedes **T95** one commit
  later: shortening the retention treated the symptom, and the line it changed is
  gone with the job.

  The division is now the one the two workflows were always named for. `ci.yml`
  runs typecheck and tests on every push — about twenty seconds, no Windows
  runner, no binary, nothing to store. `release.yml`, triggered by a tag, is the
  only thing that builds the app and the only thing that keeps the result, as a
  release asset people can actually install.

  The `package` job it replaces did `npm run dist` on every push to `release/*`
  and uploaded the 94 MB installer as an artifact. A week of work made 39 of
  them, 3.6 GB, and then `upload-artifact` began answering
  `Artifact storage quota has been hit`. That failed the step, the step failed the
  job, and a red CI is what stops `release.mjs` pushing a tag — so v0.2.6 could
  not be released because a throwaway copy of its output had nowhere to go, on a
  build whose typecheck, tests and `npm run dist` had every one of them passed.
  All 39 artifacts were deleted; both repositories now hold none.

  What that job did catch is worth naming rather than glossing: a broken
  packaging config, before a tag existed. It is now caught by `release.yml`
  instead, **after** the tag — and since a tag on origin is never moved, that
  costs a version number and a re-cut. Nothing broken reaches a user either way,
  because `release.yml` runs `npm run dist` before it publishes anything, so the
  failure mode is "no release", never "a bad installer".

- **T95** — CI keeps a built installer for three days instead of fourteen.

  Found by it breaking a release rather than by reading the config. The `package`
  job uploads a 94 MB installer on every push to `release/*`, and a fortnight of
  those is what a week of work produces: 39 artifacts, 3.6 GB, then
  `Failed to CreateArtifact: Artifact storage quota has been hit`. That failed the
  upload, which failed CI, which — correctly — refused to let `npm run release`
  push a tag for a build whose typecheck, tests and `npm run dist` had all passed.

  Three days is still long enough to download a build somebody just pushed, and
  nothing durable was ever in that bucket: every released installer is a release
  asset in this repository and in the public artifact repository, `latest.yml`
  included. The 35 artifacts already sitting there were deleted, which is what
  unblocked v0.2.6.

## v0.2.6 — 2026-08-24

### Changed

- **T94** — `.eaaw/` is ignored.

  Local state of a tool that runs beside the repository rather than in it:
  `env.json` is per-machine, `lang.json` and `cloud-workers-approved` are one
  developer's choices, and `logs/app.log` is output. Nothing in `src/` or
  `scripts/` reads any of it.

  Ignored for the same reason `.claude/gitconfig.yml` is, plus one that is not
  theoretical: `scripts/release.mjs` refuses to start on a dirty tree, and
  `git status --porcelain` counts an untracked directory. An untracked folder
  nobody meant to commit was blocking a release.

### Documentation

- **T93** — The memory bank records the two-sided token story, and closes a
  question it had carried open for three rounds.

  New doc `behavior/token-survival.md`: why two programs hold the same OAuth pair,
  the three guards that stop either overwriting the other, which call sites
  harvest and when, and what is left when the grant really is dead. The topic had
  outgrown `account-switching.md`, which now points at it instead of describing a
  switch-time-only rescue that stopped being switch-time-only at T88.

  `active-context.md`'s open question — "lost to a switch, or to the 30-day
  expiry?" — is answered rather than deleted: neither, and the log named it. Two
  new active decisions come out of the round: a guard belongs where every caller
  passes rather than on the path the report names, and fail-closed applies in
  whichever direction the write is going.

### Added

- **T92** — Every account card carries a **Login again** button.

  A grant that is genuinely dead — revoked, or past its 30-day absolute expiry —
  has always needed a fresh login, and the only route to one was *Add account*,
  which reads as adding a second copy of an account you already have. It never
  was: `upsertSecret` matches a login to an entry by account uuid, so signing the
  same account in again lands on that entry. The button says so out loud instead
  of leaving the user to discover it.

  It is on every card, not only the failing ones. Whether a grant is dead is
  something the app learns from a poll, and hiding the button until then hides it
  exactly when it is wanted.

  The dialog it opens is the existing one, told which account it is repairing: it
  names the account in its heading and its button, and says plainly that the token
  follows the account signed in as — sign in as somebody else and their entry is
  the one updated, because the identity in the token decides, not the button
  pressed.

  One thing had to change for a re-login to work at all: the dialog closed itself
  by watching the account count, which never moves when a login repairs an entry
  that already exists. It now closes on a store counter the login actions bump —
  both routes, the sign-in window and the pasted code.

### Fixed

- **T91** — A token the app refreshes for the active account now reaches
  `~/.claude/.credentials.json`, not just the vault.

  Two programs read that pair: this app polls with the vault's copy, Claude Code
  starts with the file's. Only the vault was being written, so after any refresh
  of ours the file held a refresh token the app had already spent. Claude Code
  then failed its own refresh the next time the user worked, and what it left
  behind was the token-less blob T89 now rejects. From the user's side that is a
  logout out of nowhere, fixed only by pressing *Switch* again — the "sign in
  again" they actually see, and the half no guard in the vault could reach.

  `updateAccountOauth` mirrors the pair to disk when the account is the active
  one. Every refresh in the app arrives there — the poller's and the server's
  alike — so neither call site had to change.

  Fail-closed on the same proof `captureRotatedToken` demands: the write happens
  only while `~/.claude.json` still names this account by uuid. If the user has
  logged in elsewhere behind the app, the file belongs to that account and writing
  this pair over it would destroy *its* only way to refresh — the same loss, in
  the other direction. It also never throws: a locked file, or one caught
  mid-write, is logged and does not turn a successful refresh into a failed poll.
  A file whose blob is already this pair is skipped, which is what makes the
  rescue's own write a no-op instead of churn.

- **T90** — The rotated-token rescue no longer reverts an account to a token the
  app itself already spent.

  T88 put `captureRotatedToken` on the path of every poll, and with it a bug that
  had been harmless while it only ran at switch time. Its test for "Claude Code
  rotated our token" is that the refresh token on disk differs from the stored
  one — but that is equally true in the *opposite* direction. The poller and the
  server both refresh, both write the new pair into the vault, and nothing wrote
  it into `~/.claude/.credentials.json`, so the two sides legitimately disagree
  with the vault ahead. The rescue read that backwards and copied the file's
  spent pair over the live one, which no retry can undo.

  Three times in the logs, always the same three lines:

  ```
  16:42:52 INFO  [usage] refreshed embteam05 -> …AgAA
  16:45:23 INFO  [vault] recovered a rotated token for embteam05 (…dwAA)
  16:47:53 WARN  [usage] needs signing in again — HTTP 400 invalid_grant
  ```

  Again on 08-23 at 14:16 → 14:18, and on 08-24 at 13:23 → 13:25. Nothing the
  user did caused it; the account simply died about three minutes after a
  successful refresh.

  `expiresAt` settles the direction. A real rotation always carries a later one,
  so the file is harvested only when it is *strictly* newer, and anything else —
  our own refresh, an equal expiry, a missing one — is left alone and logged. That
  answers a question the memory bank had carried open for three rounds: the
  account that lost its grant lost it neither to a switch nor to the 30-day
  absolute expiry.

- **T89** — A `.credentials.json` carrying no tokens is no longer read as a login.

  `readCredentials` returned `claudeAiOauth` verbatim, so a blob that is present
  but token-less counted as a credential. That is not a hypothetical shape: it is
  what Claude Code leaves behind when its own refresh fails, and
  `logs/app-2026-08-24.log` caught the consequence at 13:25:45 —
  `recovered a rotated token for … ((none))`, the rescue harvesting an empty pair
  into the vault, followed one second later by
  `needs signing in again — Token refresh failed with HTTP 400` with no OAuth
  error body at all, because the request carried no refresh token to reject.

  The check is at the read rather than at the three call sites, all of which treat
  a returned object as usable: the rescue now sees "not logged in" and leaves the
  vault alone, `importCurrentAccount` refuses to import a token-less account
  instead of storing one, and `verifyApplied` correctly reports credentials that
  vanished.

## v0.2.5 — 2026-08-20

### Fixed

- **T88** — An account whose token Claude Code rotated no longer gets stuck at
  "sign in again".

  Claude Code refreshes the active account on its own schedule — roughly every
  eight hours, whenever the user is working — and rotates **both** halves of the
  OAuth pair, with nothing on the wire to announce it. The vault kept the pair it
  had written. So the next poll spent an access token that was already revoked
  (`HTTP 401`), retried with a refresh token Claude Code had already spent
  (`HTTP 400 invalid_grant`), and the account stayed broken until it was imported
  by hand. Nothing the user did caused it and nothing they could do fixed it.

  `captureRotatedToken` — which already existed to save the outgoing account's
  rotation during a switch — is now exported and called from the poller's
  `accessTokenFor`, **before** the freshness check rather than after. Harvesting
  first turns the whole sequence into a no-op: the vault picks up the live pair
  off disk, the token then reads fresh, and no refresh is attempted at all. It
  takes `home` directly instead of a prebuilt `ClaudePaths` so both call sites
  can invoke it cheaply — one small JSON read and one decrypt, returning at the
  first comparison whenever nothing rotated, which is every account but the
  active one, and that one too most of the time.

  It stays fail-closed. Credentials on disk that have moved on but whose
  `accountUuid` does not name the stored account are left alone and logged, not
  harvested — writing a stranger's token into an account is worse than the 401
  this fixes.

  Six tests cover the harvest, the no-op path, and every fail-closed branch:
  wrong identity beside the tokens, missing identity, no active account.

## v0.2.4 — 2026-08-18

### Fixed

- **T81** — Opening the Usage tab no longer forces a full sweep every time.

  `usage:start` called `refreshNow()` whenever the poller was already running,
  and `refreshNow()` deliberately breaks the stagger: it polls every account at
  once. The page mounts far more often than the interval elapses, so navigating
  to the tab ten times fired ten simultaneous rounds — which is precisely what
  makes the usage endpoint answer `HTTP 429` and then report nothing at all.
  The app was manufacturing the throttling it then displayed.

  It now calls `refreshIfStale()`, which sweeps only when the newest figure is
  already older than one interval. First open: nothing to show, so it polls.
  Second open a minute later: the staggered round is already delivering, so it
  does not. Open again after the interval has elapsed: it polls. Pausing and
  resuming still sweeps immediately — that is a deliberate human action, and it
  goes through `start()`, not this path.

  Measured on the running app, not just in the suite: seven visits to the tab
  produced **one** round of two probes in the log. The same sequence before this
  change produced two rounds, and would have produced seven had the second bug
  below not been masking it.

- **T81** — A `refreshNow()` already in flight is now shared rather than
  duplicated. Two calls that arrived before the first had recorded anything both
  saw an empty snapshot map and both swept; observed at startup 0.3 s apart,
  where React's development double-mount reaches it, and reachable in a packaged
  build by double-clicking the tab.

- **T81** — A backed-off account no longer looks like polling having died.

  After a 429 the account is held for at least a full interval — the curve
  starts at `2^0 × interval` and the cap is the same 5 minutes as the default.
  `pollOne` skipped it in silence, recording nothing, so `fetchedAt` froze and
  the page counted "last result 437s ago" past a 300 s interval with nothing to
  explain it. With one account every tick was a no-op and the page looked dead.

  `UsageSnapshot` gains `retryAt`: when this app will next try, distinct from
  `resetsAt`, which is when Anthropic reopens the window. The page reads it and
  says "1 account backing off, next attempt in 214s".

  `fetchedAt` is deliberately **not** refreshed on a skipped tick. It says how
  old the figure is, and the figure did not get any newer — fabricating it would
  reset the counter by lying, which is the same mistake this bank already
  refuses for reset times.

  A test asserting the opposite was written first and corrected: it demanded the
  frozen timestamp move, which would have required exactly that lie.

### Changed

- **T84** — The network and background layers talk through the logger. The
  request server, the usage poller, the Anthropic client, the tray and the
  updater now reach the same daily file as everything else, so a rate limit or a
  failed refresh is still readable tomorrow.

  The injected sink stayed exactly as it was: `log?: (message: string) => void`
  on both `ServerDeps` and `PollerDeps`, which is what the 83 cases in
  `tests/server.test.ts` and `tests/usage.test.ts` pass. Only the default
  changed — with no sink injected, which is what the app itself does, a line
  goes to `log.<level>` under its `[server]` / `[usage]` tag. That is what lets
  a line carry a level at all without an object ever reaching the logger.

  Levels follow the same policy as the vault: `debug` for the routine — the
  per-request line and the per-account probe line — and `warn` for anything a
  user would want to find later: a refused token, a failed refresh, an upstream
  that did not answer, a rate limit, an interrupted stream, a backoff, a
  rejected OAuth grant and an account that needs signing in again. The unhandled
  request path is `error`.

  The server writes one `debug` line per request, from `res.on('finish')` so
  every route through the handler is covered, including the ones that return
  early. It carries method, path, status, duration and the account label —
  nothing else. No headers and no body, because this line is written at the
  default threshold, and the query string is cut before it is logged.

  Three silent `catch` blocks in `src/main/anthropic.ts` now say something: an
  identity lookup that failed or answered non-2xx (which is why an account shows
  as "Account N"), and a usage response that was not JSON.

  `src/main/profiles.ts` had raw control bytes inside a filename-sanitising
  character class, which made every `rg` and `grep` sweep of `src/main` skip the
  file as binary — including the token-leak gate, and including the search that
  would have found the `console.warn` still sitting in it. The class now spells
  the same range as `\x00-\x1f`, the file is text again, and its one log line
  goes through `log.warn` under the existing `[profiles]` tag.

- **T83** — The IPC layer talks through the logger, and there is now a way into
  the log file from the app. All fourteen `console.*` sites in `src/main/ipc.ts`
  go through `log.*` with their `[ipc]` / `[rotation]` / `[usage]` / `[login]` /
  `[server]` tag preserved — including the `guard` funnel every synchronous
  handler routes its failures through, and the three hand-written `catch` blocks
  that repeat it for the async ones.

  Two token redactions moved onto a line of their own, in `ipc.ts` and in
  `store.ts`. Both were already correct — the value logged was always
  `redactToken(...)` — but the leak gate this work is verified with greps for a
  `log.*` call sharing a line with the name of a token field, and it cannot tell
  a redacted read from a raw one. A gate with a false positive in it is a gate
  nobody runs, so the call sites moved rather than the gate.

  `settings:set` now calls `setLogLevel` when the patch carries `logVerbose`, so
  turning the detail off takes effect on the running process instead of at the
  next start.

- **T82** — The vault talks through the logger. All twelve `console.*` sites in
  `src/main/store.ts` now go through `log.*` with their `[vault]` / `[profiles]`
  tag preserved, so everything they say reaches the log file as well as the
  console.

  Levels follow the policy the rest of this work uses: a degraded or surprising
  state is `warn` — `safeStorage` unavailable, an undecryptable account, a
  profile that could not be written, a poll interval reset off the floor,
  duplicates merged, an unverified identity on import, `~/.claude.json`
  disagreeing with the credentials beside it, and every way a switch can fail to
  stick. A state change is `info`: the vault loading, a rotated token recovered,
  an account activated.

  Two `catch` blocks stop being silent. The predicate inside `upsertSecret`
  returned `false` for an account it could not decrypt, so importing quietly
  created a second copy of an already-present account and said nothing; and the
  rotated-credential recovery returned on a decrypt failure with a comment
  claiming `activateAccount` would report it — which is true of the path the
  user drives, but that recovery also runs at load and behind every poll, where
  nothing reported anything at all. Both now report through `warnLocked`, the
  funnel that was already there and already deduplicates by account id, so a
  locked account still costs exactly one line per session rather than one per
  poll.

  `loadVault` gained the line that anchors every session: how many accounts came
  back, and from which file.

### Added

- **T86** — A *Logs* card on the Settings page, between Window and Updates. It
  holds the two things a user needs from this work without a support call: a
  **Write detailed logs** checkbox bound to `Settings.logVerbose`, and an **Open
  log folder** button calling `window.api.openLogFolder()`.

  The checkbox rides the same draft-then-Save flow as the rest of the form, and
  `settings:set` already calls `setLogLevel` when the patch carries
  `logVerbose` — so turning the detail off stops `DEBUG` reaching the file on
  the running process, not at the next start. A failure from the button lands in
  the form's existing error banner rather than a new one.

  Labels are English to match the page; nothing else on it is translated.

- **T85** — The safety net: a crash in either process now leaves a line behind.
  `process.on('uncaughtException')` and `('unhandledRejection')` sit at module
  scope in `src/main/index.ts`, so a throw during startup is caught too. Neither
  exits — this app sits in the tray holding the server and the poller up, and a
  stray rejection from one HTTP call is not a reason to take the other machines'
  proxy down with it.

  `initLogger` is the first thing inside `app.whenReady()`, before `loadVault()`,
  so a vault that fails to load is itself in the file; the threshold follows
  `logVerbose` only afterwards, since that setting lives in the vault. One
  `INFO [app]` line names the version and the platform, which is the anchor a
  bug report starts from.

  The renderer reaches the same file with no new channel.
  `webContents.on('console-message')` forwards the window's console under a
  `[renderer]` tag with its `sourceId:lineNumber`, mapping Chromium's level onto
  ours; `main.tsx` therefore only has to call `console.error` from its
  `window.addEventListener('error')` and `('unhandledrejection')` handlers — and
  that still works when `window.api` is the thing that broke. Three more ways
  the window can die are covered: `render-process-gone` with its reason and exit
  code, `preload-error` (which used to leave `window.api` undefined and every
  button dead with nothing on screen saying why), and `unresponsive`.

  The catch in `src/renderer/src/store.ts` that feeds the error banner now also
  writes a `[store]` line, so an IPC failure survives the user closing the
  dialog.

- **T83** — `logs:open`, the channel behind `window.api.openLogFolder()`. The
  handler creates the directory before handing it to `shell.openPath`: on a
  machine that has logged nothing yet there is nothing to open, and `openPath`
  answers a missing path with an error string rather than creating it. The
  directory itself comes from one exported `logDirectory()` — `initLogger` and
  the button read the same function, because two of them drifting apart would
  surface as an empty folder in front of a user trying to file a bug.

- **T83** — `Settings.logVerbose`, defaulting to `true`. On, `debug` lines reach
  the file; off leaves state changes and failures. No migration needed: `loadVault`
  spreads `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` under whatever the vault holds, so an existing
  install picks the default up on its next load.

- **T81** — `src/main/logger.ts`, the one place a main-process line becomes a
  log line: four levels, a local timestamp carrying its own offset, the existing
  bracket tag, and two sinks — the console and `<userData>/logs/app-<day>.log`.

  The file sink is the point. A packaged NSIS build has no console, so every one
  of the 33 `console.*` sites in `src/main` was writing into nothing the moment
  the app left a dev machine; a user reporting a bug had no artefact to attach.

  One file per local day, so there is no rotation logic to get wrong — rolling
  over is only a different name. Local rather than UTC because a UTC day
  boundary cuts "today" at 07:00 for a UTC+7 user, who then attaches the wrong
  file. Retention is two passes at every day change, not only at startup, since
  this app lives in the tray for weeks: files past `RETENTION_DAYS` (14) go, and
  if the directory is still over `MAX_TOTAL_BYTES` (50 MB) the oldest go until it
  is not. The file being written into is never deleted.

  Two constraints are load-bearing and deliberate. The module must never reach
  `electron`, directly or transitively: `tests/server.test.ts` and
  `tests/usage.test.ts` import `src/main/server.ts` and `src/main/usage-poller.ts`
  without an `vi.mock('electron')`, so the log directory arrives through
  `initLogger` and lines go to the console alone until it does. And the message
  parameter is a `string` with no object overload — the shipped threshold is
  `debug`, so a signature accepting a response or a header map would put writing
  a live credential to disk one autocomplete away.

  A disk failure inside the logger is swallowed and the console copy goes out
  first: losing a line beats losing the process.

### Documentation

- **T87** — The memory bank records the logging convention. New
  `docs/memory-ai/rule/logging.md`: the line format, the four levels and what
  belongs at each, the twelve bracket tags, the retention passes with their two
  constants, and the two rules that are load-bearing rather than stylistic —
  `logger.ts` may never reach `electron`, and the message parameter is a `string`
  with no object overload.

  Four docs were wrong until this commit, not merely incomplete.
  `architecture/module-map.md` had no `logger.ts` and no reason for it sitting on
  the Electron-free side; `interface/ipc-surface.md` was missing `logs:open`
  entirely, which is a channel the renderer can call; `data/settings-model.md`
  listed eight settings keys for a `Settings` that now has nine, and its side
  effect table omitted `setLogLevel`; and `rule/testing-conventions.md` claimed
  `logger.ts` and `updater.ts` were untested when `tests/logger.test.ts` and
  `tests/updater.test.ts` both exist.

  Two entries added to `progress.md` under *Known issues*, both real and both
  consequences of decisions taken deliberately: nothing but the call sites keeps a
  secret out of the file, since redaction is the caller's job and the only gate is
  a grep; and every line is an `appendFileSync`, one open and close per line, on
  whatever path emitted it.

  `active-context.md` names the two checks of this round that are user-facing and
  have not been watched — a thrown error in DevTools reaching today's file as
  `ERROR [renderer]`, and the detail switch stopping `DEBUG` without a restart.
  Written down as open rather than assumed, which is the standard the rest of the
  bank holds a feature to.

## v0.2.3 — 2026-08-17

### Changed

- **T80** — `.claude/gitconfig.yml` is no longer tracked. It holds `auto_push`
  and `protected_branches` for the local commit tooling — per-developer
  behaviour, not a property of the repository — and it had been sitting modified
  and uncommitted across four merges, which is exactly what `scripts/release.mjs`
  refuses to start on.

  Gitignoring alone would not have helped: the file was tracked, so the working
  tree would have stayed dirty. `git rm --cached` untracks it while leaving the
  local copy in place, so nothing changes on this machine.

  The consequence, stated: a fresh clone has no such file, and
  `apply_commits.py` then creates commit-only defaults — `auto_push: false`.
  Failing toward "does not push" is the right direction, but a new machine has
  to opt back in deliberately.

  `.claude/commit-backup.json` is ignored alongside it; it is a crash-recovery
  scratch file the commit tooling deletes on success.

### Documentation

- **T79** — The bank describes an app with no proxy and a feature called the
  server. `behavior/relay-server.md` → `behavior/server.md`; fourteen docs
  touched; `overview.md` and `memory.md` regenerated — 30 docs, validate strict
  PASS.

  Two stale *facts*, not just stale prose, and both would have misled the next
  reader: `data/claude-code-files.md` still pointed its `source:` at
  `claude-settings.ts` and its own deleted test file, and
  `rule/testing-conventions.md` still listed that module as covered. The same
  doc also claimed this app owns "four keys inside `env`" of
  `~/.claude/settings.json` — it now owns **nothing** there and only ever copies
  the file.

  `interface/claude-code-io-api.md` lost its whole `## claude-settings.ts`
  section and went from three modules to two.

  The proxy verification gap is recorded as **closed by deletion**, in those
  words, with a strikethrough rather than being removed. It was the bank's
  oldest open item across four rounds; a gap that vanishes silently reads like
  it was solved.

  Three new known issues in `progress.md`: the vault's dead-key list is now up
  to eleven, `profiles.ts` still propagates proxy keys nothing can edit, and
  `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` has no replacement. A fourth records that the rename
  turned a running server off — observed by launching the app, not predicted.

  `active-context.md` gets the through-line the four rounds actually share:
  **a capability nobody has watched work is a liability, not an escape hatch.**
  The gateway's return as the server is the same rule producing the opposite
  answer once a need existed, not a reversal of its deletion.

  A blanket `sed` rewrote the historical branch name `feat/relay-server` into
  nonsense inside `active-context.md`. Caught by reading the output. A rename
  pass cannot be trusted on prose, and history in particular must keep the names
  it actually had.

### Changed

- **T78** — The relay is the **server**. `src/main/relay.ts` →
  `src/main/server.ts`, `tests/relay.test.ts` → `tests/server.test.ts`,
  `RelayPage.tsx` → `ServerPage.tsx`, and every identifier, settings key, IPC
  channel value, DOM id, log prefix and user-visible string with it. `rg -in
  relay src/ tests/` is silent.

  It was always a server — the app's one inbound surface, the only direction
  nothing else in it points — and now the name says so. One commit rather than
  two, because splitting the main process from the renderer would have left a
  failing typecheck in between.

  `/_relay/health` → `/_server/health`. `'relay:status'` / `'relay:new-token'` →
  `'server:*'`. The `netsh` rule the page prints is now named
  `"Manager Account AI server"`, so a machine that already ran the old one has a
  stale rule for the same port — harmless, but it is there.

  **The three settings keys renamed with no migration**, as chosen:
  `relayEnabled` / `relayPort` / `relayToken` → `server*`. Confirmed by running
  it: the app came up with the server **off**, the old keys sitting in the vault
  as dead JSON. Ticking *Serve other machines* and pressing Save minted a fresh
  token — the first time that path has actually run, since before this the token
  always existed already. The vault's dead-key list is now eleven.

  Verified against the running app: sidebar reads `Accounts | Usage | Server |
  Settings`, the badge goes `Server off` → `Server :8787`,
  `/_server/health` answers 200 with the token and 401 without it over both
  loopback and the LAN address, and `/_relay/health` is gone — it now falls
  through to the upstream forward like any other unknown path.

  One string the mechanical pass got wrong and a human had to fix: the checkbox
  read "Serve the server". It says "Serve other machines".

### Removed

- **T77** — The Claude Code proxy. Gone: `src/main/claude-settings.ts`, its 19
  tests, `ProxyPage.tsx`, the `proxy:get` / `proxy:set` / `proxy:clear` channels
  and their handlers, `ProxySettings`, the three preload methods, and the Proxy
  entry in the sidebar.

  The reason is the one this branch line has used three times already: the
  memory bank's oldest open item was that **no value this feature wrote had ever
  been watched working against a real proxy**. A capability nobody has confirmed
  is a liability, not an escape hatch. Deleting it closes that gap by deletion,
  which is at least an honest way to close it.

  `claude-settings.ts` died whole. Its one export that was not about the proxy,
  `claudeSettingsPath`, turned out to be called only by the three proxy handlers
  and its own test, so nothing had to be rehomed. `homedir` left `ipc.ts` with
  them — the deletion made it unused.

  What is **lost**, said plainly: `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` has no replacement. A
  machine behind a TLS-inspecting corporate proxy now edits
  `~/.claude/settings.json` by hand, or Claude Code fails its handshake with no
  hint from this app.

  What is **not** fixed by this: `profiles.ts` still blind-copies
  `~/.claude/settings.json` into every launcher profile, so proxy variables an
  older build or the user's own hand left in that file keep being mirrored. The
  app stops managing the proxy; it does not stop carrying it. The comment there
  now says so. `tests/profiles.test.ts` keeps its `HTTPS_PROXY` fixture on
  purpose — it asserts mirroring, not the proxy, and swapping the key would be
  churn.

  Two comments in `ipc.ts` still contain the word and are correct: `net.fetch`
  really does resolve the machine's own proxy, and a proxy really is one reason
  the login window can fail.

### Documentation

- **T76** — The memory bank describes an app that serves as well as consumes.
  New `behavior/relay-server.md`; six docs touched; `overview.md` and
  `memory.md` regenerated — 30 docs, validate strict PASS.

  The correction that mattered most was in `behavior/account-rotation.md`. It
  stated flatly that the live-429 fast path "left with the gateway" and that the
  poller was the only source. T74 made that false, so the section is rewritten
  as two sources with the `resetsAt` / `expiresAt` split spelled out — the first
  is never fabricated because the UI shows it, the second is what stops a stale
  429 benching an account after its window reopened.

  `active-context.md` had framed the whole branch as subtraction. Rather than
  recasting the removal as a mistake, the entry keeps both halves of one
  argument: the gateway was deleted for want of a confirmed reason, the reason
  arrived, and the code came back from git history with its guard replaced and
  its verification done as it landed. That is now an active decision in its own
  right — deleting and restoring cost less than a feature flag, and left no dead
  branch in between.

  What is *not* claimed: `progress.md` records the relay as verified by `curl`
  over loopback and this machine's LAN address, and explicitly **not** from a
  second machine. The `netsh` rule has never been run and the one attempted
  round trip to Anthropic died on the active account's dead refresh grant. Four
  ceilings are recorded as known issues rather than argued away: plain HTTP, one
  shared account and quota, a plaintext `relayToken`, and in-memory 429 readings.

- **T75** — The *Relay* page, between Proxy and Settings, plus a `Relay :<port>`
  badge in the StatusBar so a port handing out a live credential is never
  serving unnoticed from any page.

  Four cards. The state and the port. The access token, with *Regenerate* and
  the warning that it cuts off every machine still holding the old one. The
  lines to run on the other machine, one for Command Prompt and one for
  PowerShell, filled in from `RelayStatus.lanUrls` — with a picker when this
  machine is on more than one network, and a warning instead of a snippet when
  it is on none. And the `netsh` rule, with the reason it is printed rather
  than run: silently opening a port to the network is not something software
  should do behind the user's back, and without it the other machine just times
  out with nothing to go on.

  Enabling the relay with no token mints one first rather than surfacing main's
  refusal — there is no decision there for the user to make.

  A last card says what is actually being turned on: a live credential attached
  to any request carrying the token, plain HTTP so the token and every prompt
  cross the network unencrypted, and one account and one quota shared by every
  client with a rotation here changing all of them mid-session.

  One defect found by looking at the running page rather than the diff: the
  token field was masked while the same secret was spelled out in full in the
  two setup lines below it. Masking that does not mask is theatre, so the
  switch is now page-wide — the field and both lines hide together, and Copy
  still puts the real value on the clipboard.

- **T74** — The relay is wired into the app: `syncRelay()` in `ipc.ts`, started
  at boot next to the updater, stopped on `will-quit`, and re-synced by
  `settings:set` whenever `relayEnabled`, `relayPort` or `relayToken` changes.
  The re-sync is forced rather than compared by port, because the token is
  captured at bind time and a port comparison would miss a token that changed
  under an unchanged port.

  `relay:new-token` mints 24 random bytes as base64url and persists them. It
  restarts a running relay on purpose: every client holding the old token is cut
  off the moment the user regenerates. The renderer never chooses this value —
  it is the only lock on a port that carries a live credential.

  `RelayStatus.lanUrls` comes from `os.networkInterfaces()`, IPv4 and
  non-internal only. Loopback is deliberately excluded: it is the one address
  that works here and nowhere else, so printing it in the list a user copies to
  another machine would be the most misleading thing the page could do.

  **Rotation gets its fast path back.** `410e570` recorded losing it when the
  gateway went: a 429 on a real request used to override the poller immediately,
  and after the removal an account out of quota sat unnoticed for up to one poll
  interval — five minutes by default. `relayRateLimits` restores it, entries
  expiring after their reset or after five minutes when upstream named no time,
  and `accountsRemove` clears an account's entry so a re-imported id does not
  arrive already benched.

  Verified against the running app, not just the suite: `npm run dev` with the
  relay on, `/_relay/health` answered 200 with the token and 401 without it,
  over loopback and over the machine's LAN address alike. The log line for the
  refusal names the path and no token.

- **T73** — `src/main/relay.ts`: an HTTP port other machines point
  `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` at. A request arrives with the shared token, this process
  attaches whichever account is active, forwards to Anthropic and streams the
  answer back. It is `src/main/gateway.ts` from T63/T64, restored from history
  and opened up — the per-request credential swap, the refresh-when-stale path,
  the chunk-by-chunk stream and the `parseRateLimitHeaders` read are unchanged,
  because they were right.

  Two things did change. It binds `0.0.0.0` rather than `127.0.0.1`, which is
  the whole point: a machine that is not this one has to be able to reach it.
  And the loopback `Host` guard is **replaced**, not joined, by a mandatory
  shared token. That guard existed for DNS rebinding — a page resolving to
  127.0.0.1 reaches a loopback port from the user's own browser — and the token
  covers the same attack better, because such a page cannot read it. It also
  covers the case the Host guard never had to: the neighbour on the LAN.

  The comparison is `timingSafeEqual` behind a length check, not `===`. The
  length check is not decoration: `timingSafeEqual` *throws* on unequal
  buffers, so without it a wrong-length guess becomes a 500 that tells the
  attacker the length was wrong. A test pins that.

  The token stops at this hop. `authorization` and `x-api-key` were already
  stripped from what gets forwarded; a test now asserts the relay's own secret
  never appears in the request to Anthropic.

  16 tests in `tests/relay.test.ts`, over a real socket. The streaming one
  counts `data` events rather than comparing the joined body — a relay that
  buffered would pass the body assertion and fail the users.

  Not encrypted, and said out loud in the module header: plain HTTP, so the
  token and every prompt cross the LAN in the clear.

- **T72** — The settings, the status shape and the two channel names the relay
  will need. `Settings` gains `relayEnabled`, `relayPort` (8787) and
  `relayToken`; `RelayStatus` carries `running`, `port`, `baseUrl`, `lanUrls`
  and `error`; `IPC.relayStatus` and `IPC.relayNewToken` join the map.

  `relayStatus` is one name in both directions, the way `gateway:status` was:
  the renderer invokes it on mount, main pushes the same shape on it when the
  relay starts, stops or fails. A second broadcast-only channel would have been
  a second name for one fact.

  Two refusals in `store.ts setSettings`, not in the form. A relay port outside
  1..65535 throws, and `relayEnabled: true` with an empty `relayToken` throws —
  the relay binds every interface and attaches a live Claude credential to
  whatever it accepts, so an unlocked port must not be reachable through a bad
  `settings:set`. The renderer is a trust boundary.

### Fixed

- **T67** — Three stale claims in `docs/memory-ai/progress.md`. The installer has
  been per-machine since T61, not per-user. The public releases repository and
  `RELEASES_TOKEN` were listed as not yet existing; both exist and `v0.2.1` and
  `v0.2.2` are published there — what is actually true is narrower and worth
  keeping, that `v0.2.0` has no release page in either repository because its
  publish failed on a 403 and a published tag is never moved. And with two
  releases in the public repository the self-update loop is exercisable for the
  first time, which is now recorded as open work rather than as done.

### Documentation

- **T71** — The memory bank and the README match an app with one proxy and no
  tunable Anthropic addresses. Eleven durable docs touched, `overview.md` and
  `memory.md` regenerated: 29 docs, validate strict PASS.

  Two docs the plan listed were opened and **left alone**, which is the useful
  part of the result: `data/claude-code-files.md` and
  `behavior/account-switching.md` both talk about "the proxy this app writes into
  `~/.claude/settings.json`" — that was always Claude Code's proxy, so every
  sentence survived the deletion word for word.

  Where the removed thing carried a reason, the reason had to be re-homed rather
  than deleted with it. `behavior/app-lifecycle.md` used to flag that
  `applyProxy()` was not awaited; the flag is gone and the paragraph now says why
  there is no ordering left to get wrong. `behavior/app-update.md` explained the
  `electron-updater` partition through the proxy that had to be pushed onto it; it
  now explains the partition and records that nothing needs to reach into it.
  `interface/anthropic-endpoints.md` states the cost of fixed addresses instead of
  claiming an override that no longer exists.

  `README.md` also loses its "in development, visible but not runnable yet"
  paragraph — a stale claim from before T65, advertising the deleted gateway. The
  proxy it mentioned in the same breath is now listed under what the app does.

- **T66** — The memory bank matches an app with no gateway. Two docs deleted
  (`interface/gateway-api.md`, `behavior/gateway-request-flow.md`), fifteen
  rewritten, `overview.md` and `memory.md` regenerated: 29 durable docs, validate
  strict PASS.

  Not a find-and-delete pass. Where the gateway explained *why* something is the
  way it is, the reason had to survive without it — `account-rotation.md` now
  states plainly that the poller is the only source and what that costs in
  latency, and `account-switching.md` says there is no longer any way to land a
  switch inside a running Claude Code session. `ui-conventions.md` keeps both
  work-in-progress patterns as history and extracts the rule that outlived them:
  a flag is deleted by the change it was waiting for.

### Removed

- **T69** — The three Anthropic addresses are constants in the app, not settings.
  `usageEndpoint`, `oauthTokenUrl` and `oauthAuthorizeUrl` are gone from
  `Settings` and `DEFAULT_SETTINGS`, the URL-validation loop in `store.ts` goes
  with them (nothing left in `Settings` is a URL), `oauthOverrides()` is deleted
  along with both call sites, the poller's `getEndpoint` returns
  `ANTHROPIC_USAGE_URL` outright, and the Settings page loses its "Usage endpoint"
  field.

  The two OAuth keys had no UI at all — they arrived with the gateway, to point a
  login at a stand-in server, and nothing has pointed one anywhere since. The
  usage endpoint had a field for a real reason, recorded in the comment above it:
  the address is undocumented, so the day Anthropic moves it every account reads
  as "no figures". That reason has not gone away — it has been accepted. A moved
  endpoint now costs a build rather than a setting, and the comment above
  `ANTHROPIC_USAGE_URL` says so.

  What is deliberately **kept**: the `tokenUrl?` / `authorizeUrl?` parameters on
  `refreshAccessToken`, `exchangeAuthorizationCode`, `startLoopbackLogin` and
  `startManualLogin`, and `getEndpoint` on the poller. Those are injection points
  the tests use to stand up a local server — 25 tests across `tests/oauth.test.ts`
  and `tests/usage.test.ts` pass a URL through them. Only the settings plumbing
  that read from the vault is gone.

- **T68** — The app's own proxy is gone: the `proxyRules` / `proxyBypass` settings,
  `applyProxy` / `applyProxyTo`, the bootstrap step in `index.ts`, the
  `applyProxyTo(loginSession)` call, the `settings:set` re-apply branch, and the
  `UPDATER_SESSION_PARTITION` constant that existed only to be given a proxy. The
  Proxy page keeps one section instead of two and loses its second Save button.

  There were two proxies and only one of them did anything. Claude Code's proxy
  makes the CLI reachable from behind a corporate proxy; the app's was a second
  set of fields for the same job, aimed at the app's own requests, and it had
  never been verified against a real proxy.

  **This is a behaviour change, not only a deletion.** With the field empty,
  `applyProxy` pushed `{ mode: 'direct' }` onto every session — which
  deliberately *ignored* whatever proxy the machine was configured with. Removing
  it hands proxy resolution back to Chromium's default, so on a machine behind a
  proxy the usage poller, the sign-in window and the update check now go through
  it instead of being forced past it. Better on such a machine, and identical on
  one connecting directly.

  Dropping the bootstrap step also closes the race the memory bank recorded: the
  proxy was applied with `void`, not `await`, so a request could reach the network
  before it landed. There is no step left to lose.

  A vault already on disk keeps its two `proxy*` values as dead JSON, the same way
  the `gateway*` values were left in T65. Forgetting a proxy the user set is what
  removing the feature means; no migration is added for a file the user owns.

- **T65** — The gateway is gone: `src/main/gateway.ts`, its page, its 17 tests,
  the `gateway:status` channel and both preload methods, the StatusBar badge,
  and the `gatewayEnabled` / `gatewayPort` / `gatewayUpstream` settings with
  their validation in `store.ts`.

  It was a loopback port that handed a live Claude credential to whatever
  reached it, and it had never been verified against a real Claude Code. The
  guard work in T63 made it defensible, not necessary.

  **What is lost, stated plainly.** Rotation had a fast path: a 429 the gateway
  saw on a real request overrode the poller's reading and triggered
  `evaluateRotation` immediately. That path is gone, so an account that runs out
  of quota is now noticed by the poller alone — up to one poll interval later,
  five minutes by default. Switching accounts is untouched: it writes two files
  and never went through the gateway. What it never did, and still does not, is
  land inside a Claude Code session that is already running; the credential is
  read once, at startup.

  A vault already on disk keeps its three `gateway*` values as dead JSON —
  `store.ts` merges what it finds over the defaults, nothing reads them, and no
  migration is added for a file the user owns.

### Changed

- **T70** — Claude Code's proxy is now just "the proxy", in every layer. There is
  no second one left to tell it apart from, so the qualifier went: `ClaudeProxy` →
  `ProxySettings`, `ClaudeProxyConfig` → `ProxyConfig`, `readClaudeProxy` /
  `writeClaudeProxy` / `clearClaudeProxy` / `hasClaudeProxy` → `readProxy` /
  `writeProxy` / `clearProxy` / `hasProxy`, the IPC channels `claude-proxy:get` /
  `:set` / `:clear` → `proxy:get` / `:set` / `:clear`, the preload methods
  `getClaudeProxy` / `setClaudeProxy` / `clearClaudeProxy` → `getProxy` /
  `setProxy` / `clearProxy`, and the `[claude-proxy]` log tag → `[proxy]`.

  `src/main/claude-settings.ts` keeps its filename: it is the
  `~/.claude/settings.json` module, and the proxy is one thing it writes there.

  Two pieces of prose had gone stale the moment the app's proxy was deleted, and
  both are user-facing. The SOCKS refusal used to end "the app's own proxy in the
  section above can still be SOCKS", pointing at a section that no longer exists;
  it now stops at the advice that is still true. And the Proxy page's single card
  loses the "Claude Code proxy" heading that merely repeated the page title,
  taking the `Section` helper with it — one section needs no section component.

- **T64** — Proxy has its own page, in the sidebar where Gateway used to be, and
  `SHOW_NETWORK_FEATURES` is gone with the collapsed "coming in a later release"
  card it gated.

  Both proxies moved there, because they are the two things users mix up: this
  app's own proxy (`proxyRules` / `proxyBypass`, applied to the Chromium session
  the poller and the sign-in window travel through) and Claude Code's proxy (env
  variables written into `~/.claude/settings.json`). Separate drafts and separate
  Save buttons — they are separate writes to separate files, and one Save would
  suggest a single setting.

  The Settings page's whole-draft save now deletes `proxyRules` and `proxyBypass`
  from its patch, alongside the `theme` it already deleted. Without that, a
  Settings form left open since before a proxy was saved would write its stale
  copy back over it. That rule was written on the Gateway page; it had to outlive
  the page it was written on.

### Added

- **T63** — The gateway is open. Its four defects are fixed and
  `GATEWAY_READY` is gone — deleted rather than flipped to `true`, since every
  branch behind it was then dead.

  **A `Host` guard, in front of every path including health.** Binding 127.0.0.1
  keeps other machines out; it does not keep a web page out. A page on evil.com
  whose domain resolves to 127.0.0.1 reaches this port from the user's own
  browser, and a browser sends the site's own name in `Host`, never ours — so
  that is the header worth checking. `127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, `[::1]` and `::1`
  pass, with or without a port; anything else is 403.

  **One rate-limit reader instead of two.** The response is now read through
  `parseRateLimitHeaders`, which accepts both `rate_limited` (what live responses
  send) and `rejected` (what a third-party proxy sends), and puts the reset
  through `toEpochMs`. The hand-rolled check matched only `rejected` and read the
  reset with `Number()`, so an ISO-8601 value became `NaN` and fed the next bug.

  **A bench that ends.** `gatewayRateLimits` entries carry `expiresAt` separately
  from `resetsAt`: upstream's own time when it gave one, otherwise five minutes
  (`GATEWAY_LIMIT_FALLBACK_MS`). An entry with no end benched an account until
  the app restarted, and a fabricated `resetsAt` in the UI is a number the user
  would plan around. Entries are also dropped when the account is deleted.

  `tests/gateway.test.ts` drives all of it over a real loopback socket with
  upstream injected — 17 cases. One of them records that an HTTP/1.1 request with
  no `Host` never reaches the handler at all: Node answers 400 first, so the
  guard's missing-`Host` branch is there for HTTP/1.0, where the header is
  optional.

  Not yet verified end to end against a real Claude Code — that is the next step.

### Changed

- **T62** — `npm run release patch` now carries the whole release in one pass:
  the cut as before, then the branch push, the CI wait, the tag push, and the
  `--no-ff` merge of `release/<x>` into `developing` and `developing` into `main`.

  No stage flags. A release that stops halfway is a release somebody has to
  remember to finish, which is why `main` sat at the initial commit through the
  whole 0.2 line. Instead every stage is skipped when it is already done, so a run
  interrupted anywhere is finished by `npm run release` with no version at all: an
  existing tag is not re-cut, a tag already on origin is not re-pushed, a merge
  already made is `Already up to date`.

  What it refuses. Any branch that is not `release/*`, checked before a byte is
  written rather than three stages later. A merge whose tag is not on origin — a
  merged commit for a version nobody can install is a lie in the history. A target
  branch that has diverged from its `origin/` ref, which is fast-forwarded first
  and never rebuilt from a local fork. And the tag push and every hop into a
  protected branch are confirmed at the terminal, `auto_push` notwithstanding,
  unless `--yes` says otherwise; answering `n` to the tag push is how a release is
  cut without publishing it.

  CI is matched on the pushed commit's sha, not on the branch: `gh run list
  --branch` also returns the previous push's run, and watching that one reports
  green for work this commit never contained. Without `gh`, or when `gh` cannot
  answer, CI becomes a question for the human rather than a guess.

## v0.2.2 — 2026-08-17

### Changed

- **T61** — The installer is per-machine. It installs for every user of the
  machine, into `C:\Program Files (x86)\Manager Account AI`, and Windows asks for
  an administrator to do it — at install time, and again at every update.

  electron-builder's default for a per-machine 64-bit application is
  `C:\Program Files`. The `customInit` macro in `build/installer.nsh` rewrites it
  to the x86 tree, and only while `$INSTDIR` still holds exactly the default
  `initMultiUser` computed: a path that came from an installation already on the
  machine, or from the installer's `/D` switch, is a deliberate choice and
  survives an upgrade untouched. `customInit` rather than `preInit`, which runs
  before `initMultiUser` and would have to seed `InstallLocation` in HKLM —
  writing to the registry before the user has agreed to anything, and making a
  machine that has the old per-user install look like it has both.

  `packElevateHelper: true` is set for a reason its name does not suggest.
  `elevate.exe` is packed for any value but a literal `false`, so the line reads
  as redundant — but electron-builder gates the `isAdminRightsRequired: true`
  field of `latest.yml` on the *raw* option being truthy, and left undefined it
  writes no field at all. electron-updater would then launch the update installer
  unelevated. The first build of this change shipped exactly that `latest.yml`;
  the flag is what puts the field back.

  Two things to know before upgrading. A user without administrator rights can no
  longer install or update at all — that is the price of all users. And accounts
  do not become shared: `%APPDATA%\manager-account-ai` is per Windows user, so
  every user of the machine still keeps their own vault. A machine carrying the
  old per-user install is not left with two copies; the installer removes the
  `HKCU` one as part of installing for all users.

## v0.2.1 — 2026-08-17

### Added

- **T60** — `npm run verify:token` answers, from a laptop, the question that cost
  the v0.2.0 release two minutes and twenty seconds of building before GitHub
  refused the push: can `RELEASES_TOKEN` publish to the artifact repository?

  The write check is not an inference about permissions. It sends the request
  `git push` sends first — `GET /<repo>.git/info/refs?service=git-receive-pack` —
  which is the one that answers 403 for a token without write access, and which
  pushes nothing. On a refusal it prints the four things to check on the token, in
  the order they are most often wrong.

  It also compares `build.publish` in `package.json` against `env.RELEASES_REPO`
  in the release workflow. Those two are what the installed app reads and what CI
  writes; if they disagree, every release lands somewhere nothing ever looks. That
  half needs no token and runs without one.

  The token is never printed — last four characters, in output and errors alike.

### Changed

- **T59** — This repository publishes before the public one, reversing what T55
  set up. The argument for going public first was that a failure there, after the
  private release had landed, leaves an installer people can reach and nothing can
  update into. T58 removed that argument in the same round it was written: the
  token failure that motivated it is now caught before the build, so it can no
  longer reach either publish step.

  What is left points the other way. The private release is one API call on a
  token that is always valid and never waits on an organisation's approval;
  everything fragile — an external token, a clone, a commit, a push — sits in the
  step after it. Put the reliable one first and *was this version released at all*
  has an answer even when the second step never runs.

### Fixed

- **T58** — A token that cannot write to the releases repository now fails the
  run in seconds instead of after the build. The job opens with a
  `git push --dry-run` against that repository, which authenticates and asks the
  server for write access without pushing anything, and reports what to check on
  the token when it is refused. Before this, the same refusal cost two and a half
  minutes of building first.

- **T57** — The release workflow's one ordering guarantee was not enforced. It
  publishes the changelog commit *before* creating the release, so the tag names
  the commit it describes — but a failed `git push` did not stop the step, and
  `gh release create` ran anyway. The v0.2.0 run proved it: the push was refused
  with a 403 and the release attempt went ahead regardless.

  Nothing was published that time, because the token could not create a release
  either. Had the push failed for a passing reason instead, the result would have
  been a release whose tag names a commit that never left the runner — the exact
  thing the ordering exists to prevent.

  The cause was known and written down one comment away: pwsh does not turn a
  native command's non-zero exit into an error. Every `git` call in that step now
  goes through a wrapper that throws.
